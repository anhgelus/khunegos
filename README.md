# Khunegos

Mod creating a manhunt (not Dream's one) called a *Khunegos*.

During a *Khunegos*, one random player is selected to be the hunter and another is the prey.
Both gain a book giving them their role, and the hunter has access to the coordinates of the prey.
If the hunter kills the prey, the prey loses one heart that is dropped.
Then, anyone can take it and depose it to specific place in a village to gain a heart.
