*Khunegos* aims to create intense and stressful moments with PvP-oriented challenges.

## Khunegos: the challenge

When a khunegos starts, a message is sent to the chat.
Two players are selected and the game gives them a book.
It contains all important information: their role, the end's hour and details of their task.
The end's hour is relative to the *server timestamp*.

There are two roles: the hunter and the prey.
The hunter must kill the prey.
The prey must survive.

The hunter don't know the prey but has their coordinates.
The prey don't have any information.

The hunter can get prey's coordinates each 10 seconds with the command `/coords`.

A khunegos ends when the prey is killed by the hunter or when the end's hour is reached.
If the prey is killed, the hunter wins.
Else, the prey wins.

When the hunter wins, the prey loses one heart that is dropped during their death.
When the prey wins, the hunter loses one heart that *is not dropped*.

## Prey's heart

When the prey is killed by the hunter, they drop one of their heart.
It is a custom nether star renamed with the prey's name.

Any player (including the prey themselves) can depose the heart to a village to gain one more heart.
To depose it, the player have to right-click with it on a custom invulnerable armor stand spawning at the village's center.
